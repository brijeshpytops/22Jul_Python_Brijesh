break               for                 not


False: Represents the boolean value false.
None: Represents a null value or no value at all.
True: Represents the boolean value true.
and: A logical operator used to combine conditional statements.
as: Used to create an alias for a module or to rename a context variable.
assert: Used for debugging purposes, it tests if a condition is true.
async: Declares a function as asynchronous.
await: Pauses the execution of an async function until the awaited function completes.
break: Exits the current loop prematurely.
class: Declares a new class.
continue: Skips the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration.
def: Declares a new function.
del: Deletes an object.
elif: Used in conditional statements, same as "else if".
else: Used in conditional statements to define an alternative path of execution.
except: Catches exceptions in a try block.
finally: Executes a block of code regardless of whether an exception occurs or not.
for: Used to create a for loop.
from: Used to import specific parts of a module.
global: Declares a variable as global.
if: Used to make a conditional statement.
import: Imports a module.
in: Checks if a value is present in a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, etc.).

lambda: Creates a small anonymous function.
nonlocal: Declares a variable as nonlocal.
not: A logical operator used to invert the value of a condition.
or: A logical operator used to combine conditional statements.
pass: A null statement that does nothing.
raise: Raises an exception.
return: Exits a function and returns a value.
try: Starts a block of code that will be tested for exceptions.
while: Creates a while loop.
with: Used to wrap the execution of a block of code.
yield: Pauses the function saving its state for resumption later.
